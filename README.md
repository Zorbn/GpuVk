# GpuVk
## A library for simple GPU-accelerated graphics with Vulkan.

When running the examples, make sure to compile the *.frag and *.vert shaders in the `res` directory with `glslc -c`
followed by paths to the relevant shaders. The output *.spv files should be placed in the same directories that their sources
came from.
